TLDR: verilog code for a poorly made roomba 

Name of the robot is dedicated to my amazing prof Brian Harrington

This is code for a 4-wheeled robot that moves around. The brain's of this robot is a DE2 board that will control the speed of the motor (in order to turn) when it detects something close in front of it. We used a sound sensor in order to measure the distance.
A significant part of this project was based on circuitry, sensors, motors and transistors. Just copying and pasting this code will not turn your DE2 board into robot.
