TLDR: verilog code for a poorly made roomba 

Name of the robot is dedicated to my amazing prof Brian Harrington

This is code for a 4-wheeled robot that moves around. The brain's of this robot is a DE2 board that will control the speed of the motor (in order to turn) when it detects something close in front of it. We plan to use the distance sensor in order to implement some features.
A significant part of this project was based on circuitry, sensors, motors and transistors. Just copying and pasting this code will not turn your DE2 board into robot.
